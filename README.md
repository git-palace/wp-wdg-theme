## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) & [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) on your development server
2. [Download the theme](https://github.com/WDGDC/wordpress-theme/archive/master.zip) from our GitHub [repo](https://github.com/wdgdc/wordpress-theme) into your themes directory `/wp-content/themes/`
3. Install the theme's dependencies
```
$ npm install
```
4. Run the `build` task
```
$ npm run build
```
Or watch for changes
```
$ npm run watch
```
5. Enable the WordPress theme and start coding!

## Directory structure

**All static assets**, like stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, icons and fonts should go in the `/assets` directory. All 3rd party frameworks and plugins should go in the `/assets/vendor` directory.

Feel free to use Npm for installing and updating them with the `--save` flag so our `gulp build:vendor` task can copy the files to the `assets/vendor` directory.

**SASS** is strictly required in development, use Gulp to compile the CSS files. Use components, mixins and variables folders to keep organized and build modular & reusable files.

**All PHP scripts** that aren't templates should go in `/includes`. Eg. `/includes/class-theme.php`. Refer to the WordPress Coding Standards for [naming convention](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/#naming-conventions).

**Translation files** should live in the `/languages` directory.

`node_modules` is where all **Node.js packaged modules** will be stored to be used in the Build process with Gulp. This directory is excluded from the Git repo by default. Keep it this way.

`partials` is where all the template parts used by WordPress live.

`templates` is where all user-selectable page templates live. Eg. an "About us" page `/* Template Name: About Us */` `templates/about-us.php`. Please do not clutter the root directory with WordPress templates.

`tests` include **unit testing** for our main PHP and JavaScript functionality. We encourage you to write all sort of tests for your theme here, feel free to use your favorite testing framework.

## Vendor assets

3rd party vendor files live in `/assets/vendor`, they can be either stylesheets, JavaScript, images or any kind of helper, snippet, library or framework that isn't theme related.

Use WordPress `register_style` and `register_script` to add them to your theme.

### ES2015 modules

To use the JavaScript vendor assets within ES6 modules you can whitelist them as globals in the `gulpfile.js`.

Inside the `rollup` task, add your 3rd party dependencies as follows:

```javascript
globals: {
    bows: 'bows',
    jquery: 'jQuery',
    modernizr: 'Modernizr'
},
```

Then include them in your theme's JavaScript files, note that we use the previously provided key `jquery` and not the actual global variable `jQuery`. Then we alias such variable as `$` to be used inside our module.

```javascript
import $ from 'jquery';

$('html').addClass('js');
```

Learn more about [ES2015 modules](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html).

### Default vendor assets

As you can see in the code above, we provide the following vendor assets by default:

* [bows](https://github.com/latentflip/bows)
* [jquery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
* [modernizr](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr)

Modernizr is custom built from the references within the JavaScript & CSS asset files.

### Searching for a package
[NPM packages repository](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Composer packages

There is Composer support built-in. Packages live under `/includes/vendor` and are autoloaded into the theme.

## Build process with Npm & [_Gulp_](http://gulpjs.com/)

### Installing

Use the command line to get to the root of the repo and run the following command to install node modules, including Gulp.

```
$ npm install
```

#### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This is a set of tasks to be run in the following order:

1. Compile vendor files
2. In parallel compile CSS & JS files

##### build:vendor

```
$ npm run build:vendor
```

1. Generate a custom built Modernizr file based on usage from the project's CSS & JS.
2. Copy all `dependencies` from `package.json` to the `assets/vendor` directory.

##### build:css

```
$ npm run build:css
```

1. Grab all Sass files without an underscore in front of the file.
2. Compile SASS files.
3. Autoprefixer.
4. Create compiled and minified versions of all CSS files.

##### build:js

```
$ npm run build:js
```

1. Rollup to merge all ES6 modules imported from `assets/js/site.js`.
2. Transpile all ES6 code into ES5 with Bublé.
3. Create compiled and minified versions of all CSS files.

#### Watch

```
$ npm run watch
```

The `watch` task will look for changes in the /assets/js and /assets/sass files and build them accordingly.

Please note that the watch task will not generate vendor files by default or on any file change. This has changed from previous versions of the theme. Please run `build:vendor` yourself.


##### Browsersync support
There is [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/) support. This is not enabled, nor installed by default.

```
$ npm install browser-sync
```

Then run the Browsersync server:

```
$ npm run watch:sync
```

## A note on using CSS pre-processors

We encourage all developers to use CSS pre-processors and we specially like SASS, but use whatever you feel more comfortable with. Just make sure you follow our simple rules.

1. Create a directory on `/assets` where all your files will live. Eg. `/assets/sass`.
2. Pipe the `build:css` task to compile all files without an underscore in front of the file name.
3. Hook up on the watch task for Gulp.
4. Avoid using mixins for vendor prefixes, we are already running Autoprefixer.

---

## Code Linting

### CSS
1. Install [stylelint](http://stylelint.io/) globally with NPM

```
# npm install --global stylelint
```

2. Install linter packages on Atom
```
$ apm install linter
$ apm install linter-stylelint
```

3. Select the following on linter-stylelint
> Disable when no config file is found

### JavaScript
1. Install [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) globally with NPM
```
# npm install --global eslint
```

2. Install linter packages on Atom
```
$ apm install linter
$ apm install linter-eslint
```

3. Select the following on linter-eslint
> Disable when no ESLint config is found (in package.json or .eslintrc)

### PHP
1. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
2. Install [WordPress coding standards](https://github.com/xwp/WordPress-Coding-Standards) & [PHP_CodeSniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/)

```
$ composer global require wp-coding-standards/wpcs
$ composer global require squizlabs/php_codesniffer
```

3. Find the path to your `phpcs` command

```
$ which phpcs
```

It should return a hidden directory on your home directory similar to the following:

MacOS & Linux:
`~/.composer/vendor/bin/phpcs`

Windows:
`%HOME%\AppData\Roaming\Composer\bin\phpcs`


4. Replace "bin/phpcs" with "wp-coding-standards/wpcs" and add it to your phpcs installation

```
$ phpcs --config-set installed_paths ~/.composer/vendor/wp-coding-standards/wpcs
```

5. Install the linter packages on Atom

```
$ apm install linter
$ apm install linter-php
$ apm install linter-phpcs
```
