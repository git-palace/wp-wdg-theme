# WDG Minimal Bones WordPress Theme

This base theme is a very opinionated & stripped down verion of the [Bones theme](http://themble.com/bones/) from [Themble](http://themble.com/).

It comes with [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) support by default, it was heavily inspired in [YeoPress](https://github.com/wesleytodd/YeoPress)' [default theme](https://github.com/wesleytodd/YeoPress/tree/template) configuration by [John Wesley Todd](http://wesleytodd.com/).


## Easy development

Once you have run the setup process with YeoPress, you are ready to start working with your theme. So change directory into the theme directory and run grunt.

This will watch all your files and automatically compile and optimize any files you are working on, as well as auto refreshing your browser window.

	$ cd wp-content/themes/your-theme-name-chosen-at-setup
	$ grunt
